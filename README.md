document-service
================

API for interacting with raw document store


## Usage

`package.json` is set up to use [forever](https://github.com/nodejitsu/forever) to manage processes, so `npm start` and `npm stop` will run forever to start the `server.js` script. `npm run-script list` will list out the forever processes that are running.
